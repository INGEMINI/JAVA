1️⃣ 📦 Stack → Small, Quick-Access Lockers (For temporary storage)
2️⃣ 📂 Heap → Big, Long-Term Storage Rooms (For flexible memory)

🔹 Stack (Fast & Temporary Storage)
✔ Used for: Storing method calls, local variables, and function execution.
✔ Memory Allocation: Automatic (handled by the system).
✔ Speed: Very Fast (since it works like a stack: LIFO - Last In, First Out).
✔ Lifetime: Memory is freed automatically when the method ends.
✔ Size: Limited size (depends on the system).

🔹 Heap (Flexible & Long-Term Storage)
✔ Used for: Storing objects and dynamically allocated memory.
✔ Memory Allocation: Manual (done using new keyword).
✔ Speed: Slower than stack (since memory is managed dynamically).
✔ Lifetime: Memory stays until garbage collector removes it.
✔ Size: Larger space available than stack.
