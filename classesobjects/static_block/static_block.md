In Java, a static block (also called a static initialization block) is a block of code inside a class that gets executed only once, when the class is loaded into memory. It is primarily used for initializing static variables or performing setup operations before any objects of the class are created.

Key Features of Static Block:
Executed Automatically: Runs once when the class is loaded into memory, even before the main method executes.
No Need to Call: Unlike static methods, you donâ€™t need to call a static block; it runs automatically.
Multiple Static Blocks: If a class has multiple static blocks, they execute in the order they appear in the code.

Use Cases of Static Blocks
Initializing static variables (e.g., configuration settings, database connections).
Loading native libraries (System.loadLibrary("xyz")).
Executing code before main() starts running
