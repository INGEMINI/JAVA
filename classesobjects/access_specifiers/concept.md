In Java, access specifiers (or access modifiers) define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and constructors within a program. Java provides four types of access specifiers:

1. Public (public)
   Accessible from anywhere in the program, even from other packages.
   Used when a class, method, or variable should be freely accessible.

2. Private (private)
   Accessible only within the same class.
   Used to encapsulate data and prevent direct modification.

3. Protected (protected)
   Accessible within the same package and in subclasses (even in different packages).
   Used when subclassing is required.

4. Default (No Modifier)
   If no access specifier is mentioned, it is package-private (default).
   Accessible only within the same package.
   Not accessible in different packages, even with inheritance

Summary Table
Access Specifier... Same Class... Same Package... Subclass (Different Package)... Other Package
public ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ✅ Yes
private ✅ Yes ❌ No ❌ No ❌ No
protected ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ✅ Yes (via inheritance) ❌ No
default (no modifier) ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ❌ No ❌ No

Key Takeaways
public: No restriction, accessible everywhere.
private: Strictly within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the package and subclasses (even in different packages).
Default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package only.

The key difference between "Different Package (Subclass)" and "Other Package" lies in inheritance:

Different Package (Subclass) → A class in another package inherits from the original class using extends.
Other Package → A class in another package does NOT inherit from the original class.

Key Takeaway
If a class in a different package extends the original class, it gets access to protected members.
If a class does not extend the original class, even if it's in another package, it cannot access protected members
