2️⃣ Console Class (Limited to Non-IDE Usage)
The Console class is useful for reading input securely (like passwords), but it does not work in IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

"Non-IDE usage" refers to using programming tools, compilers, or interpreters outside of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This means writing, running, and debugging code without relying on feature-rich environments like VS Code, IntelliJ, or PyCharm.

Examples of non-IDE usage:

Writing code in a simple text editor (e.g., Notepad, Vim, Nano).
Compiling and running programs via the command line (e.g., using gcc for C, javac for Java).
Using online compilers or executing scripts directly in the terminal
