A library is a collection of multiple packages.

Java’s Standard Library (JDK) contains many packages like:
java.util (for utility classes)
java.io (for file handling)
java.net (for networking)
java.lang (for core Java classes)

Since java.util is inside Java’s standard library, when we use it, we’re accessing it as part of the whole Java library.

A package is a folder that groups related classes together.

java.util is a package that contains utility classes like ArrayList, Scanner, and HashMap.
It is a single unit that organizes multiple related classes.

➡ Packages = Small units inside a library.
➡ Library = A big collection of packages.

Key Takeaways for java.lang
Core Java Package: Automatically available in every Java program (no need to import).
Contains fundamental classes like String, Math, System, Object, and wrapper classes (Integer, Double, etc.).
Handles basic operations like string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and object behavior.

Key Takeaways for java.util
Utility Package: Must be explicitly imported (import java.util.\*;).
Provides advanced tools for collections (ArrayList, HashMap), date/time (Date), input handling (Scanner), and random number generation (Random).
Helps with data structures, algorithms, and utilities beyond core Java functionalities.
